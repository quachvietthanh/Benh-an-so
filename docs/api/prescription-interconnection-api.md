# Prescription interconnection API

Base path: `/api/v1`. The live OpenAPI document is available at `/api/v1/api-docs` and Swagger UI at `/api/v1/swagger-ui.html`.

| Endpoint | Permission | Business authorization |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /prescriptions/{id}/interconnection` | `PRESCRIPTION_INTERCONNECTION_SEND` | DOCTOR and responsible for the prescription visit |
| `GET /prescription-interconnections` | `PRESCRIPTION_INTERCONNECTION_READ` | ADMIN |
| `POST /prescriptions/{id}/interconnection/retry` | `PRESCRIPTION_INTERCONNECTION_RETRY` | ADMIN; only `FAILED` submissions |
| `POST /prescriptions/{id}/replacement` | `PRESCRIPTION_UPDATE` | DOCTOR, prescribing doctor of the original (NCL-12-CN-008) |

PHARMACIST is not assigned any interconnection permission.

## Replacement prescriptions (NCL-12-CN-008)

Issuing a replacement for an interconnected prescription sends the replacement
through exactly this flow, so `interconnectionStatus`, the receipt code, the
failure reason and the attempt history behave as described below. The replacement
submission additionally carries the superseded prescription code, which makes the
simulated interconnection system mark the original as cancelled (TC-03). See
`docs/api/prescription-replacement-contract.md`.

Because a gateway failure is recorded as `FAILED` rather than thrown, a failed
replacement send leaves the original marked as cancelled **only** after a
successful retry. `POST /prescriptions/{id}/interconnection/retry` re-sends the
same payload, including the superseded code, so the existing administrator retry
completes the replacement lifecycle without any replacement-specific retry state.

## Send and retry response

Both submit operations return HTTP 200 with the following shape. A gateway failure is represented as `FAILED`, so the caller can show the recorded reason without losing the history record.

```json
{
  "prescriptionId": "a4e06ad5-d63b-4faa-a711-7bb895ec9736",
  "prescriptionCode": "RX000001",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "receiptCode": "LT-20260821-000001",
  "failureReason": null,
  "completedAt": "2026-08-21T03:00:00Z"
}
```

For a failed send/retry, `status` is `FAILED`, `receiptCode` is `null`, and `failureReason` is populated. Invalid authorization or retrying a status other than `FAILED` returns the standard 403/400 API error.

## Search

`GET /prescription-interconnections?status=FAILED&from=2026-08-01T00:00:00Z&to=2026-08-31T23:59:59Z&page=0&size=20`

`status` is required and accepts `NOT_SENT`, `SUCCESS`, or `FAILED`. Results are sorted by `lastInterconnectionAt` descending and include prescription, patient, prescribing doctor, dispensing status, interconnection status, latest error, and receipt code.
